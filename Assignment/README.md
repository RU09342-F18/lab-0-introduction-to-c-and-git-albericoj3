# math.h and math.c

These two files will be used as headers for an existing calculator application. The purpose of creating math.c is to add aditional functionality to the math function. The operations added to the function include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, and bitwise inverse.

# Valid Input/Output

The function includes three variables: num1, num2, and Operator. num1 and num2 can be any integer number. The variable is defined as int. Valid Operator characters include: +, -, *, /, %, <, >, &, |, ^, ~. The function will not accept any other characters for Operator. Operator is defined as char.

# Implementing the new math function

#include the math.h header, then pass in the appropiate parameters to utulize the new features.
